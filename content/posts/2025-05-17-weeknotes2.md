* Got off of my six-day workweek last week and dove straight into a day and a half of cleaning the house and getting the yard back into shape. I was dead tired after, but this week has been more-ish relaxing, thankfully.

* I got a wonderful email from a reader and fellow blogger (Check out [Joel’s blog here](https://joelchrono.xyz/).) I’m sure he would say it isn’t much, but I do really appreciate the contact. It’s amazing how much motivation just one message gave me to keep going.

* I had one interview that went extremely well. Hopefully a job falls out of it. The second interview has been rescheduled because the person running it got stuck in a meeting. I sympathize, but I’d honestly rather just wait and get it done the day it was scheduled, even if it is a bit late. Now I feel like they're probably going to go with someone else.
