* Really feeling the drag at work because I'm so short on days left before switching jobs. As of the posting of this, I've only got two days left. I feel like I haven't changed my demeanor much toward my coworkers, but they interpret every joke I make as much more bold than I normally would be and attribute that to me leaving. Maybe they're right.
* I did a lot more writing this week than I expected to. A double header on Monday, the week notes of course, and some drafts in the works too. I feel like I'll swing between heavier and lighter weeks a bit, but I am really enjoying getting to write again.
* I tried setting up [Rusty Music Player Client](https://mierak.github.io/rmpc/) and the daemon it connects to, but I didn't really love the experience. I just think some apps shouldn't be so complicated and a terminal ui just doesn't work for how I'd use a music player anyway. I think I'll stick to [Strawberry](https://www.strawberrymusicplayer.org/) and [Tauon](https://tauonmusicbox.rocks/).
* I worked on a **REDACTED** project this week with **REDACTED** and **REDACTED**. We even had **REDACTED** help us out as **REDACTED**. I'm really excited to **REDACTED** on **REDACTED**.
* Did a *TON* of cleaning up in the yard and garden this morning. Helped Emily move a big Mile High Iris that was falling over, pulled a bajillion weeds, picked up after the dog, and cleaned out the garage. I have to mow tomorrow which i'm dreading. It's been raining enough that I haven't been able to mow for three weeks. The yard is a jungle. The clover is coming in nicely though!

### Playing

* Dipping in slightly to Dark Cloud 2 again. Mostly just due to not really feeling the pull to start anything new that's on the larger side. I probably won't play a whole lot more of it this time.

* Picked up Cyberpunk 2077 again, hoping to finish the DLC then go back in to the main story and finish that. I've done so much side stuff that there can't be *that* much game left.

### Listening:

* [Side Story](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/fa87551f-de56-4971-a0d1-a3c6eabc913f/side-story-05.mp3?dest-id=4970820) continues to be wonderful. This week's episode on Blue Prince has me wanting to dig back in to the game and unlock more of the deep mysteries, though I'll probably bounce right away anyway.

### Reading:

* [Joel got a new desk](https://joelchrono.xyz/blog/new-desk-and-keyboard/) and has joined the ranks of the mechanical keyboard typists. I really like the color scheme of his keys. The post somewhat inspired my Tech Loadout post from Monday.
* I stumbled into the [Scrolls](https://shellsharks.com/scrolls/scroll/2025-05-16) blog and really love it. Basically just a shotgun blast of indie web and fediverse stuff to look at in each issue. The next issue is a bit late. I really hope it continues.
* Sophy Wong has started a [Studio Notes](https://sophywong.com/studionotes/2025/5/13/just-start) blog. I love this post on some strategies to just start making something. I find myself doing the same things fairly often.
* Brendon is in Japan and has posted a [home screen update](https://wavelengths.online/posts/the-home-screen-in-japan-may-2025) from the trip. I love these kinds of posts, even if I'm not a fan of the iOS look.  Now I have to wait for a bit to post mine though so it doesn't look like I'm piling on.
* Adam over at [omg.lol](https://omg.lol) made a post about their new venture, a [web directory for their members](https://notes.neatnik.net/2025/05/seizing-the-means-of-discovery). I'm glad that the directory is viewable by non-members. It will join [Ooh Directory](https://ooh.directory) in places I visit periodically to find new blogs to follow.

### Videos:

* I stumbled upon [Bread on Penguins](https://www.youtube.com/@BreadOnPenguins) recently. I like how quickly and without fanfare she digs into each topic. I probably won't use everything she features, but I've picked up a few settings and tools from her videos that I'm sure I'll use a lot.
