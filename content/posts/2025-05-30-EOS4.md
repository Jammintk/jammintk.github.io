*This post is a part of my Embracing Open Source series. You can read the last post* [*here*](/posts/2025-05-15-EOS3)*, or if you are particularly interested in a related topic or want to get in touch with me about the series, please* [*send me a message*](/pages/contact)*.*

A common stumbling block when moving from any operating system to a new one is the question of common programs. Will the apps I use now work in the new operating system? Are there good alternatives? What makes open source software better anyway?

Well, dear reader, let me assure you that no, you will not often find a complete 1 to 1 replacement for everything you might possibly use on a day to day basis. No, not everything will work right away as if you were still on Mac OS or Windows. Open source software *isn't* better in every way just because it's open source. So many guides or articles touting the Linux experience will say absurd things just to make it sound like the transition is trivial when it absolutely is not. This post is intended to help you figure out what you can use straight away, what you might find a suitable replacement for, and what you will have to learn to live without if you really want to take the Linux plunge. These lists are by no means exhaustive and doing your own research is always a good idea before you switch over.

### The Good

If you've been using noncommercial, free, or open source software on Windows for a long time, the good news is that some of the stuff you use daily likely already has good versions available on Linux. LibreOffice is a very capable office suite for example, and may already be familiar if you refuse to pay for Microsoft's subscription offering and need offline editing options that Google Docs doesn't give you. Some proprietary software has Linux versions ready to go thanks their frameworks being multiplatform by default. In some other cases, developers are already supporting Linux.

* [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) - As mentioned before, a capable office suite with answers to Word, Powerpoint, OneNote, and Excel included. 

* [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) - A venerable audio recording and editing program, Audacity has been an open source staple for a very very long time. Audacity is now non-destructive as well, meaning operations can be undone and adjusted after being applied before a final file is exported with no quality loss.

* [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) Originally seen as an answer to Photoshop, Gimp is a powerful image manipulation application. It's not quite a perfect stand in for Photoshop these days, but it is still very useful and powerful, especially for the entry price. For digital artists, though, [Krita](https://krita.org/en/) which is built more directly with digital artists in mind and has more sensible options for accessories like drawing tablets.

* [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) - A very flexible and powerful app for notes with extensive personal wiki and information visualization options. Notion is the more commercial version of something like Obsidian, but if you already use it on Windows, Mac, or your phone, it's here on Linux too.

* [Discord](https://discord.gg) - Being built on Electron means Discord is available on Linux too, just like your Windows or Mac. Unlike the Linux versions of some chat clients, Discord's Linux version is completely feature compliant with the Windows or Mac versions. Before you say something, yes I know Discord is not open source. I am simply saying it exists on Linux. If you want an open source alternative, you should try one of the many [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) clients.

* [Firefox](https://firefox.com) - While Firefox is no longer a [perfect recommendation](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/firefox-deletes-promise-to-never-sell-personal-data-asks-users-not-to-panic/), I feel like it's still better as a browser to recommend for user privacy than Google Chrome, which coincidentally also does have a Linux version. Firefox is often the default browser option on Linux distributions, though privacy focused alternatives, like [LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net/) do exist that are based on the Firefox open source base.

* OSS Code - The open source basis for Microsoft's excellent Visual Studio Code text and code editor. Installing OSS Code means you get basically all the features you want out of VS Code, but with less snooping by Microsoft and no AI getting in your way.

### The Bad

Sometimes a Linux version isn't available and the Windows version won't run under Wine or Proton. In these categories, you can try to find alternatives. They won't always work well or may be missing features or capabilities that you would normally want to have. Many default applications fall into this category for me.  This isn't to say that the alternatives are bad per se, but the sheer variety and number of them can be staggering and finding the right one for you in a given category can be a mess.

* File Browsers - Dolphin, Nautilus, and Thunar are the big three in this space. Each comes standard on a different distribution and each has advantages. Dolphin is heavily integrated into KDE, so if you use that, Dolphin is fantastic. If you don't though, it can be frustrating to say the least. Nautilus is a little feature light for my taste. Thunar is a good middle ground, but still does some stuff I do not love.

* Media Players - The media player scene is surprisingly light on Linux. Most defaults in this space like Elisa look alright but are very light on features. More feature rich players like Strawberry tend to look rough. My pick in this space is [Tauon Music Box](https://tauonmusicbox.rocks/), which looks fairly nice and is reasonably powerful without relying on a separate music player daemon.

### The Ugly

A lot of commercial programs don't have good Linux alternatives or versions. Many proprietary protocols won't play nice with Linux, or support is handicapped at best. Rather than a list, I'll simply say that if you might be expected to use the software in question as an industry professional, then it probably doesn't have a good version on Linux. Sometimes [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) or [Proton](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton) can get you there with a Windows version, but in many cases that involves running specific, older versions of software
