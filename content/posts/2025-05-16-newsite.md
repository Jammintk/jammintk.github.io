+++

Hello dear reader, and welcome to the brand new Taming Knots! I would say it's improved, but... well it arguably hasn't. But at least it hasn't really gotten worse either. Because of this change, I want to do a rundown of how the site works now, my workflow going forward, and what that means for my writing here. Before all that, though, I should go over the old site a bit and explain *why* I would want to move.

## Goodbye, Pika.page

Like I said in my [moving post](https://taming-knots.pika.page/posts/taming-knots-has-moved) on Pika, I love Pika Page and everything else Good Enough makes. They seem to have a really great vision for the kinds of things they want to make and how to make those sustainable. To be perfectly honest, I'm kind of sad to not use their platform anymore.

The reasons I'm moving away from Pika are twofold. First, and the most practical thing, is that I am a very cheap person generally. It's very hard for me to justify spending sixty dollars a year or more (with a domain) on the blog when cheaper options that meet the same requirements are available. I put myself under very stringent budgetary constraints regularly. I understand that, for a lot of folks, sixty bucks isn't a lot and they are right. But what if I could host the blog for free on Github Pages in exchange for a little extra work on my end? That suddenly removes a ton of pressure for me to write continuously and allows me to have more fun with the writing of the blog.

The second reason is kind of linked up with that last point. I am finding a lot of enjoyment in building out a layer of services that I maintain myself or at least allow me to do some more nuts and bolts work on them. I've set up media streaming, cloud-less cloud storage, an RSS reader and subscription server, and a few other things for my home server. I originally also wanted to host the blog there, but I think it's more secure to put a separation between my personal files and the public blog. As a sort of half-step measure between having a fully managed service to blog on and hosting it myself, I've taken to using a static site generator to build and maintain the blog, but using a separate service provider to host it. The benefit? this service provider's free limitations are extremely generous. I could write thousands of posts, even with images and not run out of space. But I'm getting ahead of myself.

## Enter Hugo

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is a static site generator. Most websites on the internet are dynamic, offering interactive elements, tracking, analytics, advertising, and myriad other bells and whistles. Hugo, and similar generators like Jekyll or 11ty, work by taking some input files, usually markdown text, applying a set of HTML and/or CSS templates to them, then spitting out static HTML webpages. These pages are light and fast to load, even on slow mobile networks and thanks to the HTML and CSS, they look pretty nice too.

I started by trying Jekyll, since it came recommended by my blog pal, Joel. I ran into a snag when I tried to deploy the site though, so I eventually dropped it. I briefly looked at 11ty, but I didn't really like the setup for it. The last one I tried, Hugo, was immediately the one I stuck with. There were a few false starts surrounding theming, but eventually I realized that I was thinking about modifying an existing theme all wrong and got everything up and running fairly smoothly. 

![The website directory](../../static/2025-05-16-21-49-37-image.png)

The site directory is laid out in a sensible way. `archetypes` holds the basic layout for the front matter for blog posts. `assets` holds an override for the theme's colors (more on that in a minute) and exists to hold site assets like the favicon or other commonly used images, scss, or css that will be used all over the site. `content` is where the posts and pages live (in their own subfolders.) `data` is a folder for shortcode that can take input data from another source and output it in a nice format inside a post. I don't forsee myself using that one much. `i18n` is for localization content, basically allowing the blog to be multilingual if only it were so easy for me to pick up another language. `layouts` is for overrides to default page layouts set by the theme. `public` is where Hugo outputs the final site in HTML for consumption. `resources` holds the resources the code snippets in `data` take as input. `static` is where images that are hosted on the blog go. Finally, the `themes` directory is where the site's theme, [hugo-blog-awesome](https://github.com/hugo-sid/hugo-blog-awesome) lives. The directory structure of the theme is basically identical to the base hugo structure. The theme's files act as a base and the main directory override those files. For example, this is what `themes/hugo-blog-awesome/assets/sass/main.scss`'s first two sections look like:

```
//////////////// 1. Light Colors /////////////////
$text-base-color: #434648;
$text-link-blue: #003fff;
$text-link-blue-active: #0036c7;
$bloquote-border: #c4c8cc;
$blockquote-text: #525b66;
$inline-code-text: #333638;
$inline-code-bg: #d8dbe2;
$toc-bg: #edecec;
$go-top-bg: #dfe0e397;
$go-top-bg-hover: #dfe0e3;

$black: #0d122b;
$light: #ececec;
$smoke: #d2c7c7;
$gray: #6b7886;
$white: #fff;

//////////////// 2. Dark Colors /////////////////
$dark-text-base-color: #babdc4;
$dark-text-link-blue: #77a8fd;
$dark-text-link-blue-active: #5292ff;
$dark-bloquote-border: #4a4d56;
$dark-blockquote-text: #9b9ba3;
$dark-inline-code-text: #c2c4ca;
$dark-inline-code-bg: #2d2d2d;
$dark-toc-bg: #323232;
$dark-go-top-bg: #676767b3;
$dark-go-top-bg-hover: #676767;

$dark-black: #131418;
$dark-white: #eaeaea;
$dark-light: #1b1d25;
$dark-smoke: #4a4d56;
$dark-gray: #767f87;
```

Basically it sets a bunch of colors. Now here's the first sections of the `main.scss` file located in `asseets/sass` in the main site directory:

```
//////////////// 1. Light Colors /////////////////
$text-base-color: #000D1B;
$text-link-blue: #015D9D;
$text-link-blue-active: #004577;
$bloquote-border: #c4c8cc;
$blockquote-text: #57606b;
$inline-code-text: #000D1B;
$inline-code-bg: #d8dbe2;
$toc-bg: #edecec;
$go-top-bg: #dfe0e397;
$go-top-bg-hover: #dfe0e3;

$black: #0d122b;
$light: #e9b394;
$smoke: #D4916B;
$gray: #B47458;
$white: #ebd1c2;

//////////////// 2. Dark Colors /////////////////
$dark-text-base-color: #bfc2c6;
$dark-text-link-blue: #D4916B;
$dark-text-link-blue-active: #B47458;
$dark-bloquote-border: #4a4d56;
$dark-blockquote-text: #9b9ba3;
$dark-inline-code-text: #bfc2c6;
$dark-inline-code-bg: #005270;
$dark-toc-bg: #323232;
$dark-go-top-bg: #676767b3;
$dark-go-top-bg-hover: #676767;

$dark-black: #000D1B;
$dark-white: #eaeaea;
$dark-light: #00406d;
$dark-smoke: #00284b;
$dark-gray: #42474e;
```

As you can see, the colors have been changed. This override file lets me change those colors without modifying anything else about the theme. Similarly I can make modified copies of anything in the `themes` directory to make new overrides to change other parts of how the site looks. In fact, the `hugo.toml` file in the root of the site is itself an override of the theme's version.

## Writing

As mentioned before, all of the site's content is in markdown files and images. Markdown syntax is really easy to write in and provides *most* easy layout options. It turns `*this* **weirdly formatted** *text*` into *this* **weirdly formatted** *text*. It can handle lists, ordered lists, links, and a bunch of other useful stuff. When sent through the Hugo parser, you can even mix HTML with Markdown. That's how I've embedded the Letterbird contact form for the site in the [Contact Page](/pages/contact).

As for *how* I write the posts, I've tried a few markdown editors and I've landed on [MarkText](https://www.marktext.cc/) It does a few things for me that I really like. It can be set up to open a directory of files in the sidebar automatically so I can easily reference old posts. It supports front matter in the format Hugo expects (although I do wish it could automatically add the parameters that Hugo expects in the front matter.) It also supports automatically adding images from the clipboard or dragged into the editor to the site's `static` directory. I do wish it used the 
Hugo-accepted formatting for the image paths, but that's a fairly simple edit after I import the image itself before publishing. Hugo allows images to be called without specifying a directory. For example: `![img](/img.png)` Unfortunately this syntax breaks the image embeds in the MarkText preview.
