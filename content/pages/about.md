Hey there, my name is Brent, but I go by TK on the internet. I'm a writer, hobbyist sysadmin, video game enjoyer, linux journeyman, woodturner, and hobby tourist living in Colorado.  I write this blog in my free time. If you would like to recommend something to me or suggest a story idea based on my previous posts, please feel free to [drop me a line](/pages/contact).
